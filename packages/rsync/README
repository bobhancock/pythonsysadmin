This is the README file for the  configurable rsync.

This daemon is run in the application layer and rsyncs data from the web layer.
Normally, it will delete the data in the web layer if the rsysnc 
is successful.  You can adjust this behavior in the rsycn_ boilerplate
variable in the configuration file.

Since this is an rsync, it assumes that the directory names on the remote
and local hosts are the same and that the userid that runs this daemon has
read/write access to both.
